&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It's 9:30 a.m., and Larry Blair hopes that his 16-year-old son doesn't forget his orthodontist appointment after school.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So Blair, who is on a conference call in his office in Saratoga, Calif., pulls out his cell phone and thumbs in a short message. "can u b @ sasaki @ 330," he asks. 
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Seconds later, Aaron, sitting at his desk at Saratoga High School, feels his cell phone vibrating in his pocket. He surreptitiously looks at the screen and quietly pumps in a response: "can b there @ 320."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Welcome to the future, where the family that texts together stays together.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Instant, fast, fun and cheap, texting — sending and receiving brief text messages on cell phones and other portable devices — has been the rage in Europe since the late '90s. Now it's making inroads in the USA. Early users love it, but some people worry that it will add yet another distraction to already overtasked lives.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Teens, techies and other early adopters leading the charge to text say it's a great way to communicate when they are too busy to talk or when making a call would be rude or impractical. Parents keep tabs on kids. Business people silently check facts in meetings. Young professionals text-flirt at concerts. And teens gossip with friends, anytime, anywhere.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Teens are especially ahead of the curve: 45% of Americans ages 12-19 have a cell phone, according to market research company Teenage Research Unlimited of Northbrook, Ill. And 37% of teen cell users also use text messaging, with numbers rising every year.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Some people do it for eight hours at a time," says Lita Cho, 17, a Youth Radio reporter in Alameda, Calif.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Teens aren't the only ones. Texting in the USA has grown from 33 million messages sent in June 2001 to more than 1 billion in December 2002, says the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"When I go out, I hate to be called," says Steven Chan, 30, who owns Cyber Hunt, a cyber cafe in San Francisco. "I hate people leaving voicemail. Just text me."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Though Yankee Group analysts estimate that only 12% of cell phone users in the USA send or receive text messages, that soon could change: 144 million people — half of all U.S. residents — have cell phones, the telecommunications association says. And 90% of those phones are digital and can at least accept text messages. About 60% also can send messages, Jupiter Research says.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Texting is a small indicator that cyberspace has now arrived — not just at our desks, but in our pockets, in our hands and in our cars," says Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But is adding yet another communications tool to our already stuffed belts really a good idea?
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Some worry that texting — also known as SMS, for Short Message Service — will make people even more distracted than they already are. Instead of watching the road, will drivers be typing into their cell phones? Instead of listening to the teacher, will kids be checking their messages? Will pedestrians watch where they're going when they walk down the street?
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"I've seen a lot more people walking into parking meters," Saffo says. "No joke."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;People may be "physically present," but they're increasingly "psychologically absent," says James Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Katz says cell phones are largely responsible for the "ghosting of America," his phrase for "the hollowing-out of people. They're physical ghosts involved in their messaging and talking on the mobile phones."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But others say teens and twenty somethings who grew up multitasking might simply be able to handle more distractions.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Aaron will be on the phone at home with music playing in the background and doing homework. You're time-sharing your brain," says Blair, 47, vice president of a software company. Plus, "it has made both of us more accessible at times when even a cell phone couldn't have gotten to us."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;People have been concerned about the adverse effects of new communication tools since Plato worried that the alphabet would cause us to lose our memorization skills and cut down on our quality time together, says Howard Rheingold, a longtime technology watcher and author of Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution. "And he was right. But there's always a reason you pay the price.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Communications behavior is filling parts of our time that used to be idle or devoted to talking to strangers or noticing parts of the world that we're not going to notice as much anymore. That has an impact on individuals as well as on cities. More and more, people are walking down the street communicating with people who are somewhere else."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, he adds, "I wouldn't be so quick to judge that (teens) are paying less attention than they were before. Maybe they're multiplying the amount of attention that they pay. We call it distracted. Our grandchildren will say, 'Oh, yeah, our grandparents couldn't think on more than one track at once.' "
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Go to any high school and you're likely to see kids staring at tiny cell phone screens, picking at tiny keypads with their thumbs.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Most schools ban talking and texting in the classroom. But that doesn't stop everyone.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Though phone calls require talking, texting can be done on the sly. Some students don't even need to look at their phones as they type.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"You're not allowed, but they rarely notice if you have it under the table," Aaron says. "Teachers aren't looking around for that sort of thing. You can pass notes to people in other classes."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Some do more than that.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In January, students at the University of Maryland were caught cheating on a test by sending text messages to each other.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Rutgers' Katz says his informal surveys show that about half the students with text-enabled phones have used them in class, and a substantial minority say they know of others who have used texting to cheat. But it's no easier than other kinds of cheating, so few expect it to take off in a big way.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Regardless of where teens text, debating whether they should use the new technology "is somewhat futile," Rheingold says. "They're going to do it."
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And adults probably will continue to adopt texting as well as other new forms of communication. Why? It fulfills a deep need.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“We've had speech," Rheingold says. "We've had writing. We've had the alphabet. We've had the printing press. These are technologies for extending the way we think and communicate.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"That's what humans do: We come up with new ways to communicate and new ways to build civilizations."
